This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-minqa package of minqa.  The minqa
package provides derivative-free optimization by quadratic
approximation and was written by Douglas Bates, Katharine M. Mullen,
John C. Nash, and Ravi Varadhan.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'minqa' to
'r-cran-minqa' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.
